# Description and Review

**Purpose of study**: Gain a better understanding of the factors that influence levels of walking and pedestrian route choice. Through an improved understanding of the importance of different facets of the pedestrian environment to pedestrians the paper seeks to explore how that environment could most effectively be improved and to provide guidance for a consistent level of provision for pedestrians. Research has shown that appropriate design can increase quality and quantity of walking, be it in terms of provision of crossing facilities. Also, research in the US has shown that residents of compact, mixed use neighbourhoods are three times more likely to walk (to a store, restaurant or local park) than those living in more spacious automobile oriented neighbourhoods.

**Techniques**

+ an on-street survey that was designed to investigate values and attitudes towards different attributes of the pedestrian environment along a route
+ and finally an ‘on the move survey’ where pedestrian volunteers were interviewed while walking along the route in order to get an actual account of their experiences as they walk.

The pedestrian level of service (LOS) methodology used by Gallin (2001) is another approach which provides an “overall measure of walking conditions on a route, path or facility” examining design factors (e.g. path width, obstructions), location factors (e.g. connectivity) and user factors (e.g. pedestrian volume). 

**Results**

The results indicate that there were a number of pedestrian attributes considered important by pedestrians when walking including pavement cleanliness, safe crossing places, good connectivity and sense of security.
