# AFCEC_LiDAR

The following are tentative topic(s) focusing on LiDAR collected and managed by AFCEC (Air Force Civil Engineering Center) bases. I am currently processing LiDAR for AFCEC through my employer, so data accessibility is not an issue. I am still waiting to hear back about permission to use their data, but I am not the first to have such a request. Although not clear yet, the hope for any of these topics is to use AFCEC data to emphasize/analyze some phenomenon that not only benefits my project, but AFCEC as well. 

**Viable Topic I : temporal analysis & change detection - TyndallAFB, Florida**

topic: I want to create a map that analyzes TyndallAFB.
question: I want to find out how much devastation Florida's largest landfall storm left in it's wake.
motivation: As stated above, the overarching goal will be for this project to somehow benefit AFCEC.

additional commentary:
+ Any imagery and relevant data will likely span just prior to October 10, 2018 and after.
+ A combination of orthophotos and LiDAR might make for a great contrast for perspective and analysis.
+ The following will likely depend on the date LiDAR data was collected. The likely scenario would be to use 
satellite imagery to show TyndallAFB before Hurricane Michael and 5ppsm LiDAR following the storm.

**Viable Topic II : Subsidence Analysis - LangleyAFB, Virginia**

topic: I want to create a map that analyzes LangleyAFB.
question: I want to find out how much of LangleyAFB has subsided due to sea-level rising.
motivation: As stated above, the overarching goal will be for this project to somehow benefit AFCEC.

additional commentary:
+ temporal analysis unknown, likely would depend on collection date of LiDAR
+ subsidence data?

**Viable Topic III : Hydrology affected by desert arroyos - KirtlandAFB, CannonAFB, HollomanAFB, New Mexico**

topic: I want to create a map that analyzes either of the aforementioned bases in NM.
question: I want to find out the impact desert arroyos have on the surronding areas. Is it good, bad? Is agriculture difficult in the region because of desert arroyos or are they a tell-tale sign?
motivation: As stated above, the overarching goal will be for this project to somehow benefit AFCEC.

additional commentary:
+ It is believed that desert arroyos affect the watertable, which ultimately affects agriculture
+ arroyos form due to a dry surface not absorbing rainfall quick enough, allowing a flashflood to occur.
Maybe the occurence of arroyos is an indication of insufficient soil?
