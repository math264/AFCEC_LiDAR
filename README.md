topic: I want to design a map and narrative that explores the walkability index...
question: to assess societal infrastructure impacts...
motivation: and how we can re-define walkability to promote better health and sustainability.

# I. Introduction

Despite the associated benefits of exercise, many of us struggle to remain active trying to keep up with the hustle and bustle of life. Fortunately, physical activity is a part of our daily routine through transportation and leisurely means. Inherent though design, urban planning strives to faciliate more walking into our lifestyle. Walkability is an important urban design concept that is mutually beneficial to the well-being of communities and their efficiency. Walking enables urban planning to not only perpetuate sustainable transportation and its reduced emissions, but promote healthy and livable communities. Initially adopted in response to increased population densities and urban sprawl, walkability developed into a multi-faceted solution in health, sustainability, and livability. 

Established in 2017 by the EPA, the Walkability Index (WI) is a publically accessible metric enabling people to assess and compare neighborhood walkability. Comprised of three core elements (design, distance to transit, and area diversity), the WI's roots align with urban planning and travel. The WI is typically exists through two modes of association: walking context and urbal-rural status. Although a useful appraisal, it is not without flaw. At the whim of it's user, the index is easily predisposed towards environmental correlates that could potentially inflate the score. The WI is essentially a skeletal framework where it's metrics vary according to the given environment and the user's intent. Although widely applicable, bias is inenvitable. Where most studies and surveys hold the WI as a malleable appraisal assigned to a community or area, I aim to redefine and simplify walkability. Utilizing ground truth data comprised of metrics desireable to pedestrians, I connotate that walkability is better defined by route whereas metrics rarely change and bias is greatly reduced. 

The following map conducts it's examination on routes and their metrics in Lexington,KY. Through cartographic and user design, this map will appeal to those in city planning/urban safety and explore metrics pedestrians' value most during a walk. The user will be informed on the idea of walkability and what it means to them and their community. Those in city planning/urban safety will see walkability in a new perspective and hopefully be inspired to improve their designs.
