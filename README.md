# Project Description

Despite the associated benefits of exercise many of us struggle to remain active, trying to keep up with the hustle and bustle of life. Intentional or not, the fact remains that physical activity is a part of our daily lives. Inherent though design, urban planning strives to faciliate more walking into our lifestyle. Walkability is an important urban design concept that is mutually beneficial to the well-being of communities and their efficiency. Walking enables urban planning to not only perpetuate sustainable transportation and its reduced emissions, but promote healthy and livable communities. Initially adopted in response to increased population densities and urban sprawl, walkability developed into a multi-faceted solution in health, sustainability, and livability. 

Supplemented by US household survey data compiled by the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) in 2015, the WI contains useful information pertaining to the respondents' residencies. Respondents are categorized in a multitude of demographics including by not limited to sex, age, race/ethnicity, and education. Although vital to the WI and its accuracy, this map seeks to focus on the categories context and areas highlighted within the WI. 

Established in 2017 by the EPA, the Walkability Index (WI) is a publically accessible metric enabling people to assess and compare neighborhood walkability. Comprised of three core elements (design, distance to transit, and area diversity), the WI's roots align with urban planning and travel. The WI is typically exists through two modes of association: walking context and urbal-rural status. Although a useful metric, it is not without flaw. The index appears to be biased towards environmental correlates associated with walking for transportation, as minimal features are present to influence walking for leisure WI ratings. This limitation is a direct result of the elements used to create the index, which are solely premised within urban planning and its travel behavior research. To mitigate any unwanted fallacy, this project will only associate with walking for transportation.

**possibilities to narrow topic:**
+ Assessment of walkability index dataset and analysis to see if the index could be re-defined 
+ A comparative review of social impacts on the walkability index (WI) (e.g. transportation, food desserts/swamps)
