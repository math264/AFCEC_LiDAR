Exploration of Walkability and Its Benefits

topic: I want to design a map and narrative that explores the walkability index...
question: to assess societal infrastructure impacts...
motivation: and how we can re-define walkability to promote better health and sustainability.

# Project Description

Many of us struggle to remain active week to week, trying to keep up with the hustle and bustle of life. Sometimes we just don't have time and other things become more pressing, but the fact remains that physical activity is inherent in our daily lives. You could argure that some daily tasks promote a healthy lifestyle purely by design. Urban planning takes this into account and strives to faciliate more walking into our lives through its transportation and infrastructure designs. Walkability is an important urban design concept that is mutually beneficial to the well-being of communities and their infrastructure. Walking enables urban planning to not only perpetuate sustainable transportation and reduced emissions, but promote healthy and livable communities. Initially adopted in response to increased population densities and urban sprawl, walkability developed into a multi-faceted solution in health, sustainability, and livability. 

**possibilities to narrow topic:**
+ Assessment of walkability index dataset and analysis to see if the index could be re-defined 
+ A comparative review of social impacts on the walkability index (WI) (e.g. transportation, food desserts/swamps)
