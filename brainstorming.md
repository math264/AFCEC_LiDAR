# Backup Topics

The following are tentative topic(s) focusing on LiDAR collected and managed by AFCEC (Air Force Civil Engineering Center) bases. I am currently processing LiDAR for AFCEC through my employer, so data accessibility is not an issue. I am still waiting to hear back about permission to use their data, but I am not the first to have such a request. Although not clear yet, the hope for any of these topics is to use AFCEC data to emphasize/analyze some phenomenon that not only benefits my project, but AFCEC as well. 

**Viable Topic II : Subsidence Analysis - LangleyAFB, Virginia**

topic: I want to create a map that analyzes LangleyAFB.
question: I want to find out how much of LangleyAFB has subsided due to sea-level rising.
motivation: As stated above, the overarching goal will be for this project to somehow benefit AFCEC.

additional commentary:
+ temporal analysis unknown, likely would depend on collection date of LiDAR
+ subsidence data?

**Viable Topic III : Hydrology affected by desert arroyos - KirtlandAFB, CannonAFB, HollomanAFB, New Mexico**

topic: I want to create a map that analyzes either of the aforementioned bases in NM.
question: I want to find out the impact desert arroyos have on the surronding areas. Is it good, bad? Is agriculture difficult in the region because of desert arroyos or are they a tell-tale sign?
motivation: As stated above, the overarching goal will be for this project to somehow benefit AFCEC.

additional commentary:
+ It is believed that desert arroyos affect the watertable, which ultimately affects agriculture
+ arroyos form due to a dry surface not absorbing rainfall quick enough, allowing a flashflood to occur.
Maybe the occurence of arroyos is an indication of insufficient soil?
